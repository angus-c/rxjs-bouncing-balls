# rxjs-bouncing-balls
Bouncing balls using SVG and [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)

Still very much a WIP. Latest demo [here](http://anguscroll.com/rxjs-bouncing-balls/lib/bouncer.html)

Goal is a realistic, performant, bouncing ball simulation wherein each ball knows how to bounce regardless of environment.
